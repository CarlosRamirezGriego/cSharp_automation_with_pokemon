But, in order to build this Project from scratch, you will need to download these packages in Visual Studio 2019 using the NuGet manager:
- Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver

Download Chromedriver, Geckodriver and add them to an specific directory, I use: C:/webdrivers/
Edit your PATH environment variable and add the Path to the directory where you added your drivers.
